BRDB SQL Tables:

blobs: Stores the raw data of the world, delta_base_id refers to other blobs
revisions: Likely refers to consecutive saves on the same DB, maybe the idea here is to decrease save times by only saving the differences?
folders: Tree of ids with associated names, parent_id refers to other folders.
files: Collection of ids with associated names, parent_id refers to other folders, content_id points to the associated blob_id.

blobs are compressed using zstd compression when their compression field is set to 1.
Therefore the user MUST have zstd installed on their system.

Table structure rundown:

blobs:
{
  blob_id: Integer PRIMARY KEY,
  compression: Integer,
  size_uncompressed: Integer,
  size_compressed: Integer,
  delta_base_id: Integer,
  hash: Blob,
  content: Blob
}

revisions:
{
  revision_id: Integer PRIMARY KEY,
  description: Text,
  created_at: Integer
}

folders:
{
  folder_id: Integer PRIMARY KEY,
  parent_id: Integer REFERENCES folders(folder_id),
  name: Text,
  created_at: Integer,
  deleted_at: Integer
}

files:
{
  file_id: Integer PRIMARY KEY,
  parent_id: Integer REFERENCES folders(folder_id),
  name: Text,
  content_id: Integer,
  created_at: Integer,
  deleted_at: Integer
}


The folders and files represent a virtual file system.
